# Server Configuration Manager

Welcome to the lightweight Server Configuration Managment system, your lightweight, PowerShell based re-invention of both the Wheel and Desired State Configuration!
We offer a flexibly extensible way to define your target server's state in configuration ... and then make it happen!

Now, you probably think "That sounds great, so where's the documentation to get me started?".
Well ... you found what amounts to being a stub page. Still setting up here.

Mind you, we _will_ be documented before finishing up.
Just not quite there yet ...

> In the meantime

So, nothing to see yet, but who will this be for when it is finally public?
Well ... we're targeted at admins and devs that ...:

+ have hit the barrier with how far Group Policy can take them.
+ want to make their infrastructure management more DevOps-y.
+ want their intended state documented with source control
+ are not ready yet to fully switch over a complex workflow transformative workflow, such as a DSC-Based solution.

It also comes with little startup investment, so it can probably help with maintaining short-lived systems.
